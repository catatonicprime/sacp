# Simple Apache Config Parser
Welcome to the Simple Apache Config Parser! This package is intended to ease the parsing/analysis of apache config files. This parser uses the Apache Config Lexer provided by the [pygments](http://pygments.org/) project.

This project is still very much in its infancy, but my focus is on providing easy to use/understand object interfaces to analyze and modify apache config files while attempting to minimize the deltas between the original configs and the modified content. If this software is not quite meeting your needs, drop in an Issue and I'll do my best to address/help, but even if that's failing checkout this other neat parser [apacheconfig](https://github.com/etingof/apacheconfig).
